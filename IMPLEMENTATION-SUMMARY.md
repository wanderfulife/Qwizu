# Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management
- Created `SurveyDataContext` to manage the application state across pages
- Added context provider to the root layout
- Implemented proper file passing between pages using React Context instead of localStorage

### 2. Data Flow Implementation
- Updated the home page to store files in the context when uploaded
- Modified the processing page to retrieve files from context and process them using the `SurveyProcessor`
- Updated the results page to consume processed data from the context

### 3. File Processing
- Enabled actual file processing using the existing `SurveyProcessor` library
- Removed dummy data implementations
- Connected the UI components to real processed data

## Key Improvements

1. **Real Data Processing**: The application now processes actual survey data instead of using mock data
2. **Proper State Management**: Files and processed data are properly managed through React Context
3. **Seamless Integration**: The data flows smoothly from file upload to processing to visualization
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for missing files or processing errors

## Implementation Details

### Context Structure
The `SurveyDataContext` now manages:
- `surveyContent`: The JavaScript survey structure content
- `responseFile`: The Excel response file
- `processedData`: The processed survey data after analysis

### Page Flow
1. **Home Page**: Users upload files which are stored in context
2. **Processing Page**: Retrieves files from context and processes them using `SurveyProcessor`
3. **Results Page**: Displays processed data from context

### Data Processing
The application now uses the full processing pipeline:
1. Parse survey structure using `SurveyParser`
2. Parse Excel responses using `ExcelParser`
3. Map responses to questions using `DataMapper`
4. Calculate statistics using `StatisticsProcessor`

## Next Steps

To fully complete the implementation, the following components need to be updated:
1. Visualization components (`BarChart`, `PieChart`) to handle real data
2. Raw data display in the results page
3. Additional error handling and validation
